# Data 512: Course Project - Part 2: An Extension Plan

The course project consists of five parts, with Part 2 focusing on an Extension Plan that builds on the Common Analysis from Part 1. The goal is to develop a human-centered data science question to inform local governance about the impacts of smoke on the community. In this repository, we focus on having the plan laid out to achieve this goal. 
- Additioanlly, when proposing the external datasets, I tried acquiring them. The Jupyter notebook in the [`code/`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/tree/main/code) folder is used for data acquisition and initial data processing for this part.

## Files

- [`data-acquisition.ipynb`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/blob/main/code/data-acquisition.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook that loads, processes, and visualizes various datasets related to Clark County, WA.
- [`Extension_Plan.pdf`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/blob/main/Extension_Plan.pdf): Extension plan documented to explore various effects of smoke, particularly on health and economic issues in Vancouver, WA, caused by wildfires.

## Datasets

The following datasets are used in the notebook:

- [`FRED_Poverty_Clark_County.csv`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/blob/main/data/FRED_Poverty_Clark_County.csv): Poverty rates in Clark County.
- [`FRED_Premature_Deaths_Clark_County.csv`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/blob/main/data/FRED_Premature_Deaths_Clark_County.csv): Premature death rates in Clark County.
- [`FRED_Unemployment_rate_Clark_County.csv`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/blob/main/data/FRED_Unemployment_rate_Clark_County.csv): Unemployment rates in Clark County.
- [`IHME_Respiratory_Disease_Mortality_Washington.csv`](https://github.com/parvatijay2901/data-512-project-part2/blob/main/data/IHME_Respiratory_Disease_Mortality_Washington.CSV): Respiratory disease mortality rates in Washington.

## Usage

1. Open `data-acquisition.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells in sequence to load, process, and visualize the data.
